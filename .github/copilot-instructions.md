   - OAuth setup (Google/Facebook)
   - User session management
   - AuthGuard implementation

2. **CART_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md**

   - Cart functionality debugging and fixes
   - Dual storage system (localStorage + Supabase)
   - Auto-sync on authentication
   - Enhanced database schema for cart items

3. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**

   - Production deployment instructions
   - Environment configuration
   - Vercel setup guide
   - Fresh clone setup steps

4. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md**

   - Production readiness checklist

## 🔧 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features:

- **Authentication System**: Full Supabase integration with OAuth
- **Cart Management**: Guest + authenticated user support with auto-sync
- **Wishlist Management**: Guest + authenticated user support with auto-sync
- **Product Search**: MeiliSearch integration
- **Route Protection**: AuthGuard for authenticated routes

### 🗄️ Database Schema:

- Enhanced user_cart table with product details (title, brand, image, price)
- User preferences and settings
- Wishlist items with full product data
- Authentication linked to Supabase Auth

### 🔐 Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=tkksqwdirnbmqjsrqito.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[configured]
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEILISEARCH_HOST=http://localhost:7700
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=production_url
```

## 💡 Key Architecture Decisions:

1. **Dual Storage Pattern**: All user data (cart/wishlist) works for both guests (localStorage) and authenticated users (Supabase)
2. **Auto-sync on Sign-in**: Guest data automatically syncs to user account
3. **Enhanced Product Storage**: Cart stores complete product details for offline capability
4. **Route-based Authentication**: Public pages accessible, account pages protected
5. **Production-ready Dependencies**: All "latest" versions replaced with specific versions

## 🎯 Next Steps:

- Project is production-ready
- All dependencies audited and properly versioned
- Documentation organized in .github/docs/
- Ready for Vercel deployment

## 📝 Important Notes:

- Never run the dev server again (already running on :3000)
- All documentation moved to .github/docs/ for clean repository
- Project has been fully transformed from dummy auth to real Supabase integration
- Cart and wishlist functionality completely rewritten and tested
